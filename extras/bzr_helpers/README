Helper scripts for Bazaar
=========================

The scripts located in this directory are basic helpers to make your
access to the ABINIT Forge easier and more efficient. They have not been
tuned for dummies though, which means that they do not check the
relevancy and sensibility of their arguments.

You might have to edit the scripts if your login on the ABINIT Forge is
different from the one you have on your machine. Just fill the
"archive_user" variable in such a case.

Documentation about Bazaar may be found in "~abinit/doc/versioning".



abinit-forge-branch
-------------------

This script is meant to facilitate the downloads and uploads of branch
revisions from/into the ABINIT Forge. To get detailed instructions on
how to use it, just call it without arguments.



make-bzr-ignore
---------------

This script creates a ".bzrignore" file in the current directory. It is
meant to be called from the top source directory of ABINIT:

    ./extras/bzr_helpers/make-bzr-ignore

Its purpose is to permit anybody to toy with Bazaar, independently of an
access to the ABINIT Forge.



make-bzr-patch
--------------

This script creates a universal patch containing all the changes that
have occurred in a bzr branch. It is meant to be run from within a bzr
working tree. You may optionally specify a starting revision, in order
to include only your latest changes. To get detailed instructions on how
to use it, just call it without arguments.
