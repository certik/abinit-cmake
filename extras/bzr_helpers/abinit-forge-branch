Usage:

    $0 get two-digit-version repository branch [directory]
    ---> GET: download a branch from the ABINIT forge using the
              bzr-over-ssh protocol.

              A destination directory may be specified at the end
              of the command line. It should not exist when you run
              the command.

    $0 put two-digit-version repository branch [directory]
    ---> PUT: first-time upload of your changes to the ABINIT forge
              using the bzr-over-ssh protocol.

              The location of an ABINIT source tree may be specified
              at the end of the command line.

         Note: For subsequent runs, "bzr push" should suffice.

About the arguments:

    two-digit-version ---> the first two digits of an ABINIT version
    repository        ---> the committer's repository (usually the login)
    branch            ---> the branch to consider

    Example:

        $0 get 5.5 gmatteo devel-public

      will fetch the public development branch of Matteo Giantomassi
      for the 5.5 version of ABINIT.
