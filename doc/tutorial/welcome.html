<h1>ABINIT : the tutorials</h1>
<hr>
<p>These tutorials are aimed at teaching the use of ABINIT, in the UNIX/Linux OS 
  and its variants (OSF, HP-UX, AIX ...). They might be used for
  other operating systems, but the commands have to be adapted.
<p>Note that they can be accessed from the ABINIT web site as well as
   from your local ~abinit/doc/tutorial/welcome.html file.
   The latter solution is of course preferable, as the response time will be 
   independent on the network traffic.
<p>At present, more than a dozen lessons are available. 
   Each of them is at most two hours of student work.
   Lessons 1-4 cover the basics, other lectures are more specialized.

<p>Before following the tutorials, you should have read the 
  <a href="../users/new_user_guide.html"> "new user's guide"</a>, 
  as well as the pages 1045-1058 of the paper "<cite>Iterative minimization 
  techniques for ab initio total-energy calculations: molecular dynamics and conjugate 
  gradients</cite>", by <cite>M.C. Payne, M.P. Teter, D.C. Allan, T.A. Arias and 
  J.D. Joannopoulos, Rev. Mod. Phys. 64, 1045 (1992)</cite> or, 
  if you have more time, you should browse through the Chaps. 1 to 13 , and appendices L and M
  of the book <cite>Electronic Structure. Basic Theory and Practical Methods. R. M. Martin.
  Cambridge University Press (2004) ISBN 0 521 78285 6.</cite> The latter reference is a must
  if you have not yet used another electronic structure code
  or a Quantum Chemistry package.
<p>After the tutorial, you might find useful to learn about the tests cases contained 
  in directories ~abinit/test/fast, ~abinit/test/v1, ~abinit/test/v2, ~abinit/test/v3, ~abinit/test/v4 and 
  ~abinit/test/v5, that 
  provide many example input files. You should have a look at the README 
  files of these directories. 
<p>Additional informations can be found in the ~abinit/doc directory, including
  the description of the ABINIT project, guide lines for developpers, 
  more on the use of the code (tuning) ...

<h3><b>Brief description of each lesson's content</b> : </h3>
  <ul>
    <p><b>The lessons 1-4 present the basic concepts, and form a global entity : you should not skip one of these.</b>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_1.html">The lesson 1</a> deals with the H2 molecule 
      : get the total energy, the electronic energies, the charge density, the 
      bond length, the atomisation energy </p>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_2.html">The lesson 2</a> deals again with the H2 
      molecule : convergence studies, LDA versus GGA </p>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_3.html">The lesson 3</a> deals with crystalline silicon 
      (an insulator): the definition of a k-point grid, the smearing of the cut-off 
      energy, the computation of a band structure, and again, convergence studies 
      ... </p>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_4.html">The lesson 4</a> deals with crystalline aluminum

      distribution, the surface energy, and again, convergence studies ... </p>

    <p><b>Other lessons present more specialized topics.</b>

    <p><b> There is a group

       the properties related to spin : spin-polarized calculations and spin-orbit coupling. </p>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_gw1.html">The first lesson on GW</a> deals with the
       computation of the quasi-particule band gap of Silicon (semiconductor),
       in the GW approximation (so, much better than the Kohn-Sham LDA band structure),
       with a plasmon-pole model </p>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_gw1.html">The first lesson on GW</a> deals with the
       computation of the quasi-particule band structure of Aluminum,

    <p><b>There is an additional group of lessons
      on response functions (phonons, optics, dielectric constant, electron-phonon interaction,
      elastic response, non-linear optics, Raman coefficients, piezoelectricity ...), for which
      some common additional information are needed :</b>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_rf1.html">The lesson Response-Function 1 (RF1)</a> presents the 
      basics of response-functions within ABINIT. The example given is the study of
       dynamical and dielectric properties of AlAs (an insulator) : phonons
       at Gamma, dielectric constant,
       Born effective charges, LO-TO splitting, phonons
       in the whole Brillouin zone. The creation of the "Derivative Data Base" (DDB) is presented.</p>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_rf2.html">The lesson Response-Function 2 (RF2)</a> presents the
       analysis of the DDBs that have been introduced in the preceeding lesson RF1.
       The computation of the interatomic forces and the
       computation of thermodynamical properties is an outcome of this lesson.</p>
    <p><b>The additional information given by lesson RF1 opens the door to </b>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_optic.html">The lesson on Optic</a>, the utility that allows to
       obtain the frequency dependent linear optical dielectric function and the frequency
       dependent second order nonlinear optical susceptibility, in the simple "Sum-Over-State"
       approximation.</p>
    <p><b>The additional information given by lesson RF1 and RF2 opens the door to a group of
       lessons that can be followed independently of each other : </b>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_elphon.html">The lesson on the electron-phonon interaction</a> presents the use of
       the utility MRGKK and ANADDB to examine the electron-phonon interaction and the subsequent
       calculation of superconductivity temperature (for bulk systems).</p>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_elastic.html">The lesson on the elastic properties</a> presents the computation
       with respect to the strain perturbation and its responses : elastic constants, piezoelectricity.
       </p>
    <p>* <a href="lesson_nlo.html">The lesson on static non-linear properties</a> presents the computation
       of responses beyond the linear order, within Density-Functional Perturbation Theory
       (beyond the simple Sum-Over-State approximation) : Raman scattering efficiencies (non-resonant case),
       non-linear electronic susceptibility, electro-optic effect. 
       Comparison with the finite field technique 
       (combining the computation of linear response functions with finite difference calculations), 
       is also provided.</p>
  </ul>

<p>The following topics should be covered later : 
  <ul>
    <p>* the choice of pseudopotentials </p>
  </ul>

<p>NOTE that not all functionalities of ABINIT are covered by these tutorials. For a complete
list of functionalities, please see the directory ~abinit/doc/features . For examples on how
to use these functionalities, please see the ~abinit/tests directories, and their accompanying README files.
