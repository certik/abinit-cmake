<h1>Developing for ABINIT 5</h1>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>
This tutorial introduces ABINIT 5 to the new developers.
We want here to give a first insight into the internals of ABINIT. In other
words, you will look at what's under the cap.
Being an ABINIT user is not required though it will help a lot, in particular
when writing a test case for your contribution.
However some experience in programming is necessary if you want to take
maximum benefit from this lesson. In particular, some ease with
Fortran&nbsp;95 will be truly welcome.
Familiarity with the command line will be wonderful too.

<h2><a name="context">Context</a></h2>

<p>
The ABINIT package is aimed at being used
by different groups of people, without mandatory control by the
main contributors of the ABINIT group. In the same
way, the ABINIT development project is fundamentally open
to the contributions of various persons,
not located in Louvain-la-neuve or Corning. These external
contributors are <i>de facto</i> members of the ABINIT group.
</p>

<p>
People using the code might consider adding their personal
subroutines without trying to make them part of the
official ABINIT package.
However, this has two drawbacks for them: in subsequent versions,
their modifications will not be incorporated, so that they might
have to check and modify the interface for each new version;
moreover, their addition is not tested by other users
of the code, then some nasty bugs might remain unnoticed.
Our opinion is that it would also be nicer from them to share the
fruits of their coding efforts with other users of the code.
</p>

<p>
Of course, a collaborative effort has some drawbacks as well.
In particular, the collaboration between distant developers should
be carefully planned, since orthogonal modifications of the
same piece of code by two different people at the same time
is very likely to happen, generating "negative progress", i.e.
a large waste of time when synchronization is to be done.
It is also necessary to use a well-defined coding style, to
provide test case files, and to comment the modifications and additions
as much as possible, in order to facilitate the maintenance
and the future modifications.
</p>

<p>
The procedure we usually follow is described on the web site
in the "<a href="../developers/?text=dev_howto">How to contribute</a>"
page, in the <i>Developer's corner</i> section.
</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="objectives">Objectives</a></h2>

<p>
The main goals of this lesson are to provide you with a useful understanding
of the source tree structure and the build process, as well as sensibilize
you to the rules and procedures followed for the development of ABINIT.
In the example we have chosen, we will suppose that you want to add an
input variable to the code and create the corresponding subroutine.
For simplicity, we will now imagine that you have designed a new
exchange-correlation functional and that you want to test it with ABINIT.
Here are the steps we will take:
<ol>
 <li>Get the source and compile the code.</li>
 <li>Identify the subroutines to modify.</li>
 <li>Add the new input variable and its associated routine.</li>
 <li>Add a test to the test suite.</li>
 <li>Create a patch for the project leader.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
For this lesson, your input variable will be a real number called
"<i>lesson</i>". The task devoted to your routine is just to print
this variable.
</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="tasks">Tasks</a></h2>

<h3><a name="get">Get the source and compile the code</a></h3>

<p>
There are two ways of getting the source code of ABINIT:
<ul>
 <li>directly from the ABINIT web site
  (<a href="http://www.abinit.org/">http://www.abinit.org/</a>) by
  downloading the tarball;</li>
 <li>from the ABINIT forge, using
  <a href="http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
While the first method is straightforward, the second one requires you to
know how to use <i>BZR</i>, <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>'s
implementation of <a href="http://www.gnuarch.org/">GNU Arch</a>.
There is a comprehensive tutorial for Bazaar on the ABINIT web site, in
the <i>Developer's corner</i> section.
</p>

<p>
Once you have got the tarball, uncompress it by typing:
</p>

<div class="code">
tar&nbsp;xvzf&nbsp;abinit-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>.tar.gz
</div>

<p>
where <i>&lt;version&gt;</i> is the version number you downloaded,
e.g. "5.3.2".
Then go into the newly-created <i>abinit-&lt;version&gt;</i> directory
and have a look at it.
To get get more familiar with the source tree structure, have a closer look
at the <i>~abinit/doc/developers/dirs_and_files</i> file.
You can alternatively consult it on the website (see
"<i>Developer's docs</i>"). Then answer the following questions:
</p>

<p>
Q1. If you need off-line documentation, in which directories will you
look for?
</p>

<p>
Q2. Where can be found the external libraries?
</p>

<p>
Q3. What do the numbers in the names of the "<i>src</i>" subdirectories
stand for?
</p>

<p>
Q4. In the source subdirectories, what do the <i>abinit.src</i>
files contain? In your opinion, what is their purpose?
</p>

<p>
Q5. What kind of tests are available? How important do you think they are?
</p>

<p>
Now you can try to build ABINIT. Information on how to do it is stored
inside the INSTALL file. Please read it now.
</p>

<p>
Before actually starting the compilation, type:
<div class="code">
./configure --help | more
</div>
and read carefully the output. You might then find useful to have a look
at the template for config files stored in
<i>~abinit/doc/config/build-config.ac</i> which will provide you with more
details on the configuration.
</p>

<p>
The compilation will likely take more than 10 minutes. In the meantime,
you can proceed to the next task.
</p>

<h3><a name="identify">Identify the subroutines to modify</a></h3>

<p>
At this point, you have to discover what parts of the code will have to
be modified in order to have your contribution correctly integrated.
First choose randomly a few subroutines in one of the "<i>src/*</i>"
subdirectories and have a look at them, putting emphasis on their headers.
Then try to answer the following questions:
</p>

<p>
Q6. How would you identify the subroutines involved in the treatment
of input variables?
</p>

<p>
Q7. Where are the routines handling exchange-correlation? Which input
variables are they strongly related to?
</p>

<p>
Q8. Which subroutine would you choose as a parent for yours?
</p>

<p>
Q9. Where is the <i>wrtout</i> subroutine? What is its purpose? How does
it work?
</p>

<h3><a name="new_routine">Add the new input variable and its
associated routine</a></h3>

<p>
Please read thoroughly the file
<i>~abinit/doc/developers/programming_rules</i>.
This is an essential step before you start writing your own subroutine.
To actually start, go to the subdirectory you've identified before and
type:
<div class="code">
sh ../../util/developers/mkroutine.sh handle_lesson
</div>
This will create a file named <i>handle_lesson.F90</i>, <i>handle_lesson</i>
being the name of your subroutine.
</p>

<p>
Add treatment code for your input variable to the files you have
identified previously.
Then write your subroutine and add a call to it at a suitable place.
When you're done, issue <tt>./config/scripts/makemake</tt> from the top
source directory, to have the build system aware of the presence of your
new routine.
Last but not least, rebuild <i>abinis</i>.
</p>

<h3><a name="test">Add a test to the test suite</a></h3>

<p>
Since your contribution is to be integrated into the version 5 of ABINIT,
all associated tests should go to the
<tt>&#126;</tt><i>ABINIT/tests/v5/</i> directory.
Wander a little bit around the subdirectories of <i>tests/</i>, and have a look
at their content. Focus particularly on the <i>README</i>
and <i>tests.cnf</i> files there.
Each test is identified by an index, attributed after consulting the
ABINIT coordinator. He decided that your contribution will be checked
by test #999.
</p>

<p>
Q10. What do you need to do in order to have a new test added?
</p>

<p>
Implement your test and issue a <tt>make tests_v5 start=999</tt>
in the <i>tests/</i> subdirectory, to check that it works fine.
</p>

<h3><a name="patch">Create a patch for the project leader</a></h3>

<p>
There are two ways of creating a patch, depending on whether you are
using Bazaar or not.
If yes, you just have to register your new files, write a change log and
commit your changes.
This procedure is highly recommended, as it is very fast and as the
project leader will be provided with a lot of flexibility and
information to handle your contribution.
If not, you have to create a patch with a full description of your
changes and send it by email or ftp.
</p>

<p>
To get some comfort, the project leader needs a patch both in universal
format and where new files are considered empty in the old version.
</p>

<p>
Q11. Which options will you give to the <i>diff</i> command to produce the patch ?
</p>

<p>
Q12. How will you proceed exactly to create it ?
</p>

<hr/>

<h3><a name="solutions">Solutions</a></h3>

<p>
Even if we provide you here with the answers to some of the questions,
we highly recommend you to try by yourself before looking at them. Please
read this section only as a last resort.
</p>

<p>
R1. In <i>~abinit/doc/</i>, of course.
</p>

<p>
R2. ABINIT embeds a certain number of external libraries, which can all
be found in <i>~abinit/lib/</i>.
</p>

<p>
R3. According to <i>~abinit/doc/developers/dirs_and_files</i>, they
correspond to a hierarchical structuring of the dependencies within
ABINIT. The higher the level, the more the dependencies on lower levels.
</p>

<p>
R4. They contain the list of source files to compile, and allow the
developers to explore several ways at once by giving them the choice
of what to put in ABINIT. Thanks to their presence, no developer needs know
all the internals of the build system.
</p>

<p>
R5. The available documentation describes all tests in detail and stresses
their importance quite enough. Just read the suggested files.
</p>

<p>
R6. First, I'll have a look at <i>~abinit/doc/developers/dirs_and_files</i>,
then I would issue a <i>grep</i> command for a random input variable in order
to trace the handling of input variables throughout the code.
</p>

<p>
R7. These routines can be found in <i>~abinit/src/03xc</i>, and are driven
by the <i>ixc</i> input variable.
</p>

<p>
R8. The <i>~abinit/src/03xc/drivexc.F90</i> routine, for instance.
</p>

<p>
R9. Look in <i>~abinit/src/01managempi/wrtout.F90</i>, the header
contains detailed explanations.
</p>

<p>
R10. See self-documented <i>~abinit/tests/v5/tests.cnf</i> for instance.
</p>

<p>
R11. "-u -r -N".
</p>

<p>
R12. Supposing that you have downloaded ABINIT 5.3.2, the following set of
commands will do:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><tt>cd /path/to/my/source/dir/abinit-5.3.2</tt></li>
 <li><tt>make distclean</tt></li>
 <li><tt>cd ..</tt></li>
 <li><tt>mv abinit-5.3.2 abinit-5.3.2-lesson</tt></li>
 <li><tt>tar xvzf /path/to/abinit/tarball/abinit-5.3.2.tar.gz</tt></li>
 <li><tt>mv abinit-5.3.2 abinit-5.3.2-orig</tt></li>
 <li><tt><tt>diff -urN abinit-5.3.2-orig abinit-5.3.2-lesson &gt;
  abinit-5.3.2-lesson.patch</tt></li>
 <li><tt>gzip --best abinit-5.3.2-lesson.patch</tt></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Note: in case you are using Bazaar, you will have to exclude the '.bzr*'
files from the diff by adding "<tt>-x '.bzr*'</tt>" to the other
options.</i></p>
