1. Introduction

A few days before the developers sent their contributions
for the merge, it is worth that they examine whether they
have not forgotten to do "something". This is the aim of 
this checklist.

2. Check list

Have you mentioned your initials (or full name) in the
copyright of the routine you have modified ? 

Have you set up one (or a few) test cases, so as to provide
the input and output files as references, to check that
the merge of your routines has been succesful ?
The CPU time of this test should exceed 30secs on a PC at 400MHz,
or 15 secs on a better workstation.

Are you sure that your modifications do not deteriorate
the performance of the code in the regime where your 
modifications are not used ? You should inspect your
modifications for both memory use and CPU time.

Have you regularly run the automatic tests,
thanks to the command

make tests_dev

and inspected the fldiff files,
to be sure that your modifications do not suppress
existing functionalities of the code ?

Do not forget : after you have made all modifications, 
recompile the code, and run again all the automatic
tests. It will produce a file summary_tests.tar.gz ,
that should be joined to your contribution.
