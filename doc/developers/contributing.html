<h2><a name="con_intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The ABINIT package is aimed at being used
by different groups of people, without mandatory control by the
main contributors of the ABINIT group. In the same
way, the ABINIT development project is fundamentally open
to the contributions of different persons,
not located in Louvain-la-neuve or Corning. These
contributing persons are members <i>de facto</i> of the ABINIT group.
</p>

<p>
People using the code might consider adding their personal
subroutines, without trying to make them part of the
official ABINIT package.
However, this has two drawbacks for them: in subsequent versions,
their modifications will not be incorporated, so that they might
have to check and modify the interface for each new version ; moreover,
their contribution is not tested by other users
of the code, so that bugs might remain unnoticed.
It is also nicer to share the result of their coding efforts with other
users of the code.                                                   
</p>

<p>
Of course, a collaborative effort has also some drawbacks.
In particular, the collaboration between distant developers should
be carefully planned, since orthogonal modifications of the
same piece of code by two different people at the same time
is very likely to happen, generating "negative progress", i.e.
a large waste of time when synchronization is to be done.
Also, it is required to use a well-defined coding style, to
provide test case files, and to
comment the modifications and additions as much as possible, in order 
to facilitate the maintenance and the future modifications.
</p>

<p>
This document aims at defining the protocol to be followed
to avoid "negative progress" due to lack of synchronization. 
The analogy with the procedures
to be used for the parallelization of a code is obvious. The aim
is that each external 'node' does not waste its time, that communications
are kept at the lowest level possible, and that the final result
is correct ! We will need barriers for synchronization, and so on ...
</p>

<p>
The ability to incorporate the contributions of different groups
in a harmonious way might become a noticeable strength of the ABINIT project.
</p>

<h2><a name="con_repos">Code repositories</a></h2>

<p>
Managing different versions of ABINIT is done thanks to a utility called
<a href="http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/" target="_blank"><b>Bazaar</b></a>.
For an introduction to this powerful and versatile tool, you can have a look
at our dedicated pages in the Developers' corner of the ABINIT web site.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Bazaar, the development of a project becomes
completely transparent, since all the changes in the files
are registered: the latest version is of course available,
but one can come backwards in time to track bugs easily or
to know what anybody did.
The development of different branches is also managed, as well
as the subsequent merging procedure. This feature is important
to allow development by many different people. The place where
all the files are stored, including their history, is 
called a <b>repository</b>.
</p>

<p>
For developers, using the repository is a privileged way of managing their
contributions, since the coordinator is automatically and instantly
informed of their progresses. They also benefit from regular backups of
all the contributions.
</p>

<p>
The ABINIT repository is divided into several <b>main categories</b>:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>abinit-release</b>, where go all contributions for the official
  release packages, these contributions consisting mainly in fixes and
  documentation;</li>
 <li><b>abinit-devel</b>, where all new and ongoing developments are
  managed;</li>
 <li><b>abinit-doc</b>, containing new and incomplete documentation, until
  it is consistent enough to be moved to the source code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each category is divided into <b>versions</b>, 3 digits for
<i>abinit-release</i> and 2 digits for <i>abinit-devel</i>.
Then, in each category and for each version, there is one
<b>reference branch</b>, codename <i>merge</i>,
which is the backbone of the development effort.
All concerned developers are supposed to use this branch as a starting point
for their tasks and to keep permanently in sync with it.
They may have at least one branch of their own.
</p>

<h2><a name="con_philo">Basic philosophy</a></h2>

<p>
In the following, we will distinguish between <b>"debugging" contributions</b>
and <b>"development" contributions</b>.
</p>

<p>
<I>Debugging contributions</i> are typically modifications of a few
lines in one or relatively few routines, needed for the code to
work properly or to be properly documented. Sometimes they 
are related to comments within routines or corrections to documents.
Usually, such modifications do not need any synchronization and
can be sent directly to the coordinator via email, in the form of a patch.
It is however possible to have them synchronized by recording them inside
the <b>abinit-release</b> category of the repository.
</p>

<p>
For the time being, Xavier
<a href="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be">&lt;gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be&gt;</a>
should be contacted. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Development contributions</i> usually involve the addition of new 
capabilities to the code. Despite the use of Bazaar, synchronization
with the coordinator is <b>ALWAYS</b> needed: one has to make sure
that nobody else is already in charge of a similar project! The
development contributions might be quite local (basically
adding one routine, called by a few lines from an existing routine),
or, on the contrary, involve modifications of many existing routines.
Even for the local type of modifications, discussion with the coordinator
is mandatory. Though Bazaar now deals nicely with conflicts at the file level,
it is of great importance to avoid semantic conflicts from the very beginning.
</p>

<p>
The developer will be allocated a <i>development task</i>.
Related to this task, they will be free to code, 
experiment, debug, and check the result
of their work without any communication with the rest of the ABINIT group.
The allocation of the task has obviously to be done
in coordination with the rest of the group prior to the work,
while the result of the development has to be incorporated
into a new official version. The task is thus also limited in time.
</p>

<p>
The prior allocation and subsequent incorporation, taking into
account the possibility that many different developers work
independently, must be done centrally by one or more coordinators
(at present Xavier but this might change in the future), in order
to guarantee the harmony, relevancy and consistency of all contributions.
</p>

<p>
It will be the responsibility of the developer to make enough
checks of the correctness of their modifications or additions.
The developer should provide adequate documentation: basically
the description of the input variables and output data
in the <i>abinis_help</i> file, as well as a possible update of
the bibliography.
They should also provide one or more tests to be added to the
standard suite of tests. This is needed
to ensure that the transfer to the official version of the code
has been done properly, and also that the new capabilities
will be preserved by the subsequent modifications of the code.
Finally, they have to show that their modifications have not
suppressed existing capabilities of the codes, by running
the set of already existing automatic tests.
</p>

<p>
It will be the responsibility of the coordinator to transfer
the result of the development effort of each developer to an
official version, in such a way that the test is reproduced in a
satisfactory way. The subsequent maintenance will be automatically
done by checking that the corresponding test is still working despite
modifications.
</p>

<h2><a name="con_detail">Detailed protocol for the developer</a></h2>

<p>
<b>a.</b> The developer proposes a modification or addition to
the code to the coordinator. In most cases, such a proposal will be
warmly welcome!
There might be some discussions possibly involving other scientists
to improve the original proposal. The developers mailing list
has been set-up for that purpose (see the "Community section"
on the ABINIT web site).
</p>

<p>
<b>b.</b> With respect to the latest official version, the
developers define their task and make a list of routines they wish
to heavily modify (and those they would like to add, but this is not
really needed at that time).
Following the current coding practice, adding new input variables would
need rather small modifications of a very large number of routines
(invars, abinit, gstate, brdmin, move, scfcv, vtorho ...).
In order to avoid the allocation of too large an area of development
within the source code,
which would make other development efforts impossible, it is assumed
that the developer will make appropriate use of the different 'user'
input variables. This appropriate use means that none of the
aforementioned routines will be modified for that purpose.
The easiest case to handle is when a routine or a set
of routines are added to the package, and the interface to the rest
of the code involves only a set of called subroutines
the interface (list of arguments) should not change, and just one (modified)
calling routine. Many development projects of this type can coexist.
By contrast, if one of the development efforts
involves major changes to major routines, it will prohibit
the execution of another development project of the same type,
taking into account the current structure of the code.
</p>

<p>
<b>c.</b> Having gathered the different suggestions made on the basis of the
current official version, the coordinator releases the next version,
adequately prepared to allow the proposed developments by different
developer groups, with a list of routines allocated to each group,
the number of the test cases allocated, and, for information, the tasks
that will be done.
</p>

<p>
<b>d.</b> After installation on the development machine,
and prior to any modification, the developer runs the internal tests,
as well as the tests series <i>v1</i> to <i>v5</i> and the <i>paral</i>
(sequential cases) suite of tests. The "<tt>make tests_dev</tt>" command
is perfectly suited for that purpose.
Checking against previous reference files that the results are 
OK is always nice enough. The developer can replace the reference files
provided with the official version by those produced on their machines,
to ease further checking of the results.
Then the development effort can begin. It is expected <i>a priori</i>
that the following files will be modified in any case:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><i>abinit.src</i> files in some <i>src/*</i> directories, because
  the new routines must be listed there;</li>
 <li>the <i>keyhr.html</i> and some of the <i>var*.html</i> files,
  because the new input variables must be listed
  and documented there (the 'user' variables are now used,
  but a final, aesthetic, name should be proposed);</li>
 <li>the <i>README</i> and <i>tests.cnf</i> files in the subdirectory
  <i>v5</i>, as well as an additional input file (at least).</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<b>IMPORTANT</b><br /><br />
During the development, only the allocated routines should be
modified. This is very important. Many others can be created.
</div>

<p>
In both cases, the developers <b>MUST</b> follow the current ABINIT coding
style, presented in the latest version of the document <i>rules_coding</i>,
in the <i>~abinit/doc/developers</i> subdirectory.
In particular, they should mention their initials in the
header of the new or modified routines. This will be useful
if somebody needs information about this routine some time later.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the development effort, it is mandatory that the developer
runs again the <i>tests_dev</i> series, to be sure that the developments
have not spoiled some other feature of the code.
This is easily done by issuing <b><tt>make tests_dev</tt></b>.
This command will run automatically the required tests, and produce
a file <i>summary_tests.tar.gz</i> that should be send with the updated
routines and separate new tests.
This is important, since the coordinator will have to run the suite of
tests as well, but at that time, having trouble with a modification
done by some developer would mean an important delay in the delivery
of the new official version, and thus a large waste of time.
It is desirable that the tests of the new feature do not 
last more than 1 minute on Pentium III 1GHz, or about 20 seconds on
other (faster) processors.
</p>

<p>
<b>e.</b> After the development has occurred, the developer prepares a
gzipped (compressed) tar file with all the needed files
(additional routines, modified routines, makemake, abinis_help,
README, tests.cnf, ...), the <i>summary_tests.tar.gz</i> file,
and makes it available to the coordinator (by email, FTP or SSH).
</p>

<h2><a name="con_example">Example</a></h2>

<p>
a. David proposes a nice addition to the ABINIT package. Doug and Xavier
are enthusiastic about it.
</p>

<p>
b. On the basis of version 5.3.4, David proposes a list of routines
that should be allocated to him.
</p>

<p>
c. Xavier delivers a 5.4.x version that has been adequately prepared
for the independent development that David wants to do.
</p>

<p>
d. David implements his addition and modifications on the basis of version
5.4.x, checks whether the suite of tests is still OK,
and makes the files available to Xavier.
</p>

<p>
e. Xavier thanks David very much, transfers the work
to the official version 5.5.y and performs the final modification
of the names of the (new) input variables, including the propagation
through the routines that were not allocated to the developper.
