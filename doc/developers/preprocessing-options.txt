Preprocessing options
=====================

FIXME: this document is still incomplete.

Naming conventions
------------------

Names may contain capital letters, digits and underscores only. They
must start with a letter.

Directives related to features that may or may not be present depending
on the configuration must begin by the keyword *HAVE\_*, e.g.
*HAVE\_CONFIG\_H, HAVE\_NETCDF, HAVE\_ETSF\_XC, etc.

Version-specific directives must have the number directly attached to
the name, e.g. *MPI2*, *FC_PGI6*, etc.

In this respect, ABINIT abides strictly by the GNU Coding Standards.
This means in particular that:

 * all user-defined compiler directives should be upper case;

 * ...



If statements
-------------

*If* statements should all begin with '<tt>#if</tt>'. We kindly ask you not
to use '<tt>#ifdef</tt>', but '<tt>#if defined</tt>' instead. A line
ending an *if* statement must contain the '<tt>#endif</tt>' keyword
only. The same holds for '<tt>#else</tt>'.

Example:

<pre>
#if defined HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include "config.h"
#endif
</pre>

We thank you in advance for following these simple rules, as it will greatly
simplify the automatic checks and fixes.



Options list for ABINIT 5
-------------------------

### Generic options ###

	ABINITGW	Light version of ABINIT, for GW calculations
	CONTRACT	Design-by-contract code
	HAVE_CONFIG_H	Mandatory: use config.h if present



### Architecture-related options ###

	OS_IRIX		IRIX operating system
	OS_LINUX	Linux operating system
	OS_MACOSX	Mac OS X operating system
	OS_WINDOWS	DOS/Windows operating system
	VMS		VAX/VMS architecture



### Optional library options ###

	HAVE_COMPAQ_FFT		HP/Compaq/DEC FFT library 
	HAVE_FFTW		FFTW library
	HAVE_FFTWTHREADS	FFTW library (threaded version)

	HAVE_HP_MLIB		HP mathematical library
	HAVE_SCALAPACK		SCALAPACK linear algebra library
	HAVE_SGI_MATH		SGI mathematical library
	HAVE_IBM_ESSL		IBM mathematical library
	HAVE_IBM_ESSL_OLD	IBM mathematical library (old version)
	HAVE_NEC_ASL		NEC mathematical library

	HAVE_NETCDF		NetCDF file I/O library

	HAVE_BIGDFT		BigDFT wavelet library
	HAVE_ETSF_IO		ETSF file I/O library
	HAVE_ETSF_XC		ETSF exchange-correlation library
	HAVE_XMLF90		XML Fortran I/O library



### MPI options ###

MPI options may not be included in the config.h file, as it would preclude
the build of sequential code. They should be specified within the compiler
command line, with the --with-mpi-cppflags options of configure if needed.

	MPI		MPI statements follow
	MPI1		MPI version 1
	MPI2		MPI version 2
	MPI3		MPI version 3
	MPI_EXT		MPI HTOR routines (?)
	MPI_FFT		Parallel FFT
	MPI_IO		Parallel I/O
	MPI_TRACE	Timing within parallel routines



### Compiler options ###

	FC_ABSOFT	ABSoft Fortran compiler
	FC_COMPAQ	HP/Compaq/DEC Fortran compiler
	FC_FUJITSU	Fujitsu Fortran compiler
	FC_GNU		GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran)
	FC_G95		G95 Fortran compiler (g95)
	FC_HITACHI	Hitachi Fortran compiler
	FC_HP		HP Fortran compiler
	FC_IBM		IBM XL Fortran compiler
	FC_INTEL	Intel Fortran compiler
	FC_MIPSPRO	SGI MipsPro Fortran compiler
	FC_NAG		NAGWare Fortran compiler
	FC_NEC		NEC Fortran compiler
	FC_PGI		PGI Fortran compiler
	FC_PGI6		PGI Fortran compiler version 6.0
	FC_SUN		Sun Fortran compiler



### Fortran options ###

	HAVE_FORTRAN_EXIT		The Fortran compiler accepts exit()
	USE_CCLOCK			Use C clock for timings



### Unmaintained options ###

	OPENMP		OpenMP parallelism
	T3E		Cray T3E architecture
	TEST_AIM	Optional checks for AIM



### Removed options ###

#### OLD_INIT ####

Was used in *src/04wfs/wfconv.F90* to initialize the wavefunctions, and has
been replaced for a long time by a more efficient method.

#### PGIWin ####

The PGI Fortran compiler is no longer used to build Abinit under Windows,
since it is too buggy.

#### ultrix ####

Ultrix was an operating system based on a 4.2BSD Unix with some features
from System V. It was first released in 1984. Its purpose was to provide
a DEC-supported native Unix for VAX. The last major release of Ultrix was
version 4.5 in 1995, which supported DECstations and VAXen. There were some
subsequent Y2K patches. There has been no ABINIT user on Ultrix quite some
time.
