NetCDF API for ABINIT
=====================

Introduction
------------

While the 4.5 version was being developed, it has been decided to group
NetCDF routines in one directory, mainly to ease further enhancements.

The NetCDF API in ABINIT id divided into two parts:

 * a set of low-level atomic routines, which perform the real I/O
   operations;

 * high-level interface routines, which make up the visible part
   of the iceberg.

All are stored in the 03ionetcdf directory.

Some of them are computer-generated, at present those related to datasets.
