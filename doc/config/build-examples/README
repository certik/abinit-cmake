Building ABINIT - Examples of configuration files
=================================================

Naming convention
-----------------

The example files are named after the following convention:

<architecture>-<operating system>-<C compiler>-<C++ compiler>-<Fortran compiler>_<hostname>.ac

They correspond to the configurations which have been tested before the
release of the current version of ABINIT.
