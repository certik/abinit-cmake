Just for information, Xview (xv) can be used to visualize files
stored in many of the different file formats
(.jpg , .gif , .png ...), under Unix.
Note XG040813 : on my PC, I have problems with .gif and .png , while .jpg is OK .

Different images are stored in the ~ABINIT/Infos/Images directory.

The utility "convert" is a powerful tool to convert the 
images from one format to another.
Note XG040813 : on my PC, works well to convert .png and .gif to .jpg, that
I can visualize with  xview .
