(From MMikami, 000602)

I have tried the VASP Data Viewer 
(http://vaspview.sourceforge.net/ ), 
and have found it seems to work with "ABINIT & Cut3d". 

I have transmitted a sample output file of VASP Data Viewer.
Two type of files are available, i.e "png" and "ps"(gzipped).
(See ~ABINIT/Infos/Images)
(The snapshot was taken with the image viewer "gimp" on my Linux box.)
The example was taken from t5o_DEN in Test_fast.

In order to get the output, I first get 3D formatted data file 
from t5o_DEN with your "cut3d" utility. Then I add following lines 
at the very beginning of the 3D formatted file, as follows;

N.B.  The lattice vectors (A,B,and C) can be scaled as the above.







(From MMikami, 000609, additional information)

The latest "VASP Data Viewer" has appeard just now,
partly because I told the author the meaning of the unknown paramters
in the input file. 

In passing, I would like to tell you one more info.
      http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/xc/XCrySDen.html
This is another viewer code for such 3-D outputs, with crystal structures.
(Only the executables are distributed. To get the binaries,
 resigtration procedure is necessary. Please look into the URL for the details)

I have already contacted the author the possibility for XCrySDen to
manage the VASP-Data-Viewer-type format. He said,

    Thank you very much for suggestion. In fact several VASP users already
    contacted me with almost the same request. In fact one of them already
    wrote the VASP->XCrySDen conversion. If he will be willing to share this
    conversion program, we can hope to have have this option soon.

Dear Timothy Terriberry,

I think I have found something.

About (Q1) and (Q2), could you please refer to the following URL ?
http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/guide/node13.html#SECTION00043100000000000000

>From the POSCAR section,

(Q1) this seems a universal scaling factor (for lattice vectors) !
(Q2) "Direct" means fractional (internal) coordiates.
     In the "Cart" case, positions will be scaled by universal scaling factor.

Thanks, an updated version of the viewer that incorporates these things
has been posted (http://vaspview.sourceforge.net)
