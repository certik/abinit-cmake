  From the WEB pages:

   The Electronic Periodic Table of the Elements - The source code for
   the non-graphical based Periodic Table of the elements with data
   concerning each element, sound files in English for element name
   and chemistry definitions for Unix platforms (not Windows).
   ...

   The program, epte, contains a central screen which shows the periodic
   table of the elements and from which each letter of the alphabet
   produces a new display. The supplemental displays are of physical
   constants related to chemistry and contain references to books.
   The following tables are included:

a - Attributes of some Metals           n - Nobel Prize Awards for Chemistry
b - Bond Energies of Inorg. Compounds   o - Oxidation Potentials of Elements
c - Conversions between units           p - Physical Constants of Chemistry
d - Definitions of Chemistry            q - Quit the Program
e - Electronegativity of the Elements   r - Radii, Ionic with Charge States
f - Formula Weight Calculator           s - Solubility Products of Compounds
g - Groups of Elements by Common Name   t - Time Line of Chemical Events
h - Move LEFT or Use Left Arrow         u - Units and Prefixes of Metric System
i - Ions of the Elements with Names     v - Various Forms of Periodic Tables
j - Move DOWN or Use Down Arrow         w - Orbital Filling on Table (toggle)
k - Move UP or Use Up Arrow             x - Number the Periodic Table (toggle)
l - Move RIGHT or Use Right Arrow       y - Element Weight on table (toggle)
m - Minerals of the Earth with Formulas z - Group Labels on Table (toggle)

I tried it on a Linux box at lunch time today.
(No modifications, just "make; make install".)
It worked fine (no heavy !). Some functions would help you, e.g.
"Radii, Ionic with Charge States" etc. Several conversion functions/
calculators might also help.
