The tool (freeware) that
can convert LaTeX files (including equations) to HTML files:

"TtH" (the TeX to HTML translator)
http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/

(You will find a equation on the WEB page :
  d                   1
  -- arcsin x = ------------
  dx            sqrt (1-x^2)
 If you could not see it like the above, you might consult with
 some WEB pages there. If you use a Netscape under X, please take a
 look at " http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/Xfonts.html .")
