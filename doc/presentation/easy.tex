How difficult is it to learn to use ABINIT, \\
and then, to use it for daily work ?

\vskip 2em
The concept of {\blue self-learning} 
is central to the ABINIT project : \\
at his fingertips,
the user will find all the information he/she needs to learn
to use ABINIT 
\vskip 1em
\begin{itemize}
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  Tutorial : four {\green basic lessons} of 2 hours each (used to teach classes), and twelve {\green specialised lessons}
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  On-line help files, and on-line list of input variables
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  The input files used in the automatic tests show how
  to use {\blue all} the functionalities of ABINIT (more than 500 files).
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  ... no need to attend a school !
\end{itemize}
\vskip 1em
The daily use has also been at the center of development efforts :
\vskip 1em
\begin{itemize}
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  Pseudopotentials are available for all the elements, in LDA,
  or can be generated for the GGA 
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  Input by keywords and default values
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  Metalanguage for chaining different datasets
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  Automatic renaming of output files for bookkeeping
\end{itemize}
