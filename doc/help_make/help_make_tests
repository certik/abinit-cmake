==============================================================================
Keywords to use for test directory (automated sets of tests) :

tests_min      Minimal set of tests (sequential)
tests_min4     Minimal set of tests, 4 threads at once
tests_dev      Minimal set of tests for developers (with a report)

tests_acc      Test accuracy (=tests_min+tutorial/tutorespfn/bigdft/wannier90)
tests_acc4     Test accuracy, running 4 threads at once

tests_bench    Test accuracy+cpu for benchmarks (with a report)
tests_speed    Test cpu for benchmarks (quick, with a report)

tests_abinip   Tests using abinip instead of abinis (fast,v1-v...,tutorial)
                (WARNING : at present, works only on sleepy.pcpm.ucl.ac.be)

The description of more detailed testing possibilities can be obtained from
'make help_dev' or 'make dev'. In particular, note the following actions :

(1) to test abinip on many different specific platforms :
tests_paral

(2) to test only the features as bigdft, gw, paw, or tddft :
tests_bigdft
tests_gw     (all GW tests, except tutorial#gw_1 and gw_9, that are very long)
tests_paw
tests_tddft
