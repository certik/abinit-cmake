Typing "make" in the src directory (~abinit/src) leads to the compilation of 
all abinit sources, either standard, or following specific indications
of a config file, see ~abinit/doc/config/build-config.ac for details.
Usually, "make" should be prepared with "./config/scripts/makemake"
and "configure" from the top directory.
 
In addition, "make" can be issued with the name of
a main program (like abinis, abinip, cut3d, ...).
In this case, the selected set of routine and/or main code will be
(re)compiled.

Specific keywords for the ~abinit/src "make"

abiauty        enforce correct indentation (+...) in each *.F90 routine (all)
clean          clean all the compiled objects and executables inside src
