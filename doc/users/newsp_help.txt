     ========================================

     The reader should first consult the files 
     ~abinit/doc/users/new_user_guide.html
     and ~abinit/doc/users/abinis_help.html , before looking at the present help file.

     This is a program which allows conversion
     of a wavefunction file from one ecut to another, one
     set of lattice constants to another, or one set of k points
     to another.  It is used mainly to get new starting values
     (for a new acell, ecut, or kpt) from existing converged
     values.  The code prompts the user to provide the name of
     the known wavefunction file, then the name of a new input 
     file, and finally the name of the about-to-be-created new
     wavefunction file.  The new input file, for example,
     would contain the new ecut, acell, and rprim.  The
     prompts provided at the terminal should make the use
     of this subroutine self-explanatory.  Note that if
     a new k point grid is being created, the code will do
     the crudest possible interpolation: it searches for the
     nearest k point of the known wavefunction file and simply
     copies that data to represent the new k point.
     Newsp will not initialize more bands than provided
     in the known wavefunction file. It is also not able
     to change from spin-unpolarized wfs to spin-polarized wfs,
     and vice-versa.

     Most functionalities of newsp are available in ABINITv1.9 and 
     later versions.
