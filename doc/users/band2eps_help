program : band2eps
description :   draw the phonon dispersion curves in eps 
		from data files generated by ifc (routine sortph.f).
		The curves are drawn in color according to the 
		displacement participation of each atom .

usage : band2eps < example.file

where 'example.file' is a file containing the paths of the input files :

ex : example.file :
example.input
example.eps
example.freq
exemple.displ



The 1st file describe what you want to draw (see ex BaTiO3.input).
The 2nd is the name of the output eps file.
The 3rd is the data file from sorth.f (in ifc) containing phonon frequencies.
The 4th is the data file from sorth.f (in ifc) containing phonon displacements.
	if you want the plot in B/W just write 'no' instead of a file name.
