<h3><b><a name="a"></a>A. Introduction</b></h3>

In the section <a href="acknowledgments.html#b">B. List of suggestions</a>, you will find
several references we suggest you to cite in your papers that have benefited from ABINIT.
However, we wish first to clarify the spirit in which the present document (Acknowledgments) has 
been written. The users of the code have no formal obligations 
with respect to the ABINIT group (within the limits of the GNU General
Public License). However, it is common practice 
in the scientific literature, to acknowledge the efforts of people
that have made the research possible. 
<p>Please note the following :
<ul>
<li>1) The ABINIT project, in order to be viable, should be known 
as a robust tool, that has been tested, and that has allowed 
good scientific research. This will be
facilitated if the ABINIT project is mentioned properly in research 
papers. 
<li>2) Some recent ideas and algorithms are coded, and it
would be fair to cite these.
<li>3) It is expected also that the authors 
make the ABINIT group aware of the existence of their papers.
This operation can be done by the automatic Web registration procedure.
</ul>
In agreement with the GNU General Public License, there 
is no request for co-authorship of articles whose scientific results
have been obtained thanks to ABINIT, by any ABINIT developper. 
This applies even for recently implemented features, as their 
availability in a public version is governed by the GNU GPL license.
If you think your work could benefit from collaboration with 
ABINIT developpers, you can contact the ABINIT group 
for a possible arrangement, in which case co-authorship
should be discussed.
(Of course, the ABINIT developpers also have the right
to decline giving assistance to users ...).

<h3><b><a name="b"></a>B. List of suggestions</b></h3>

First, an overview ...
<p>
The two first papers Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#1">1</a>] and 
Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#2">2</a>] in this list of suggestions should be considered
for citation in all the papers that have benefited from the ABINIT project.
Moreover, if you used the GW part of ABINIT, the suggestion to cite 
Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#2">2</a>] is even stronger.
Self-consistent GW should be acknowledged by citing Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#13">13</a>].
Massive parallelism (coupled band / FFT) should refer to Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#14">14</a>].
Use of PAW should refer to Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#15">15</a>].
Use of the phonon or electric field response features of ABINIT should be acknowledged by citing 
Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#7">7</a>] and Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#8">8</a>]
(and Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#12">12</a>] for thermodynamical properties),
while the response to strain should be acknowledged by citing 
Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#9">9</a>].
Computation of non-linear properties (e.g. Raman scattering) should be acknowledged by citing 
Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#11">11</a>].
When pseudopotentials were generated thanks to the FHI98PP code, Ref.
[<a href="acknowledgments.html#10">10</a>] is suggested.

<p>
Now, the detailed and complete list of suggestions :
<ul>
  <li><b>B.1</b>. At least, the two papers that describe the ABINIT project should be 
    mentioned in the bibliography section of your paper:

    <br>
    These references might be properly abbreviated, of course.
    <br>
    Note that the second should be cited especially if you are using the GW
    part of ABINIT, as the authors of this part are not in the list of authors
    of the first paper. 
    The .pdf of the latter paper is available <a href="http://www.abinit.org/about/zfk_0505-06_558-562.pdf">here</a>.
    Note that it should not redistributed (Copyright by Oldenburg Wissenshaftverlag, the licence allows the authors
    to put it on the Web).
  <li><b>B.2</b>. In the body of the paper, or in the acknowledgments (can obviously 
    be modified, according to the context), either
    mention "The present results have 
    been obtained through the use of the ABINIT code, a common project of the 
    Universit&eacute; Catholique de Louvain, Corning Incorporated, 
    and other contributors (URL http://www.abinit.org)" 
    or refer to the following note:<br>
    [3<a name="3"></a>] The ABINIT code is a common project of the Universit&eacute;
    Catholique de Louvain, Corning Incorporated, and other contributors 
    (URL http://www.abinit.org).
    <br>Actually, four other institutions have significantly contributed
    to the ABINIT effort : the Universit&eacute; de Li&egrave;ge, 
    the Commissariat &agrave; l'Energie Atomique, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.,
    the Ecole Polytechnique Palaiseau.
    These (or one of these) might be also cited, just before 
    "and other contributors."
  <li><b>B.3.</b> In the core of the ABINIT code, one finds a remarkable
    Fast Fourier Transform routine, that has been written by S. Goedecker. Its speed 
    is really crucial for the code, and moreover, its availability makes the whole 
    package more portable. The ideas on which this routine is based are published 
    in :<br>
    [4<a name="4"></a>] <cite>S. Goedecker, SIAM J. on Scientific Computing 18, 
    1605 (1997) "Fast radix 2, 3, 4 and 5 kernels for Fast Fourier Transformations 
    on computers with overlapping multiply-add instructions"</cite>. 
  <li><b>B.4.</b> The determination of wavefunctions in a fixed trial potential 
    is done according to a state-by-state (or band-by-band) conjugate gradient 
    algorithm. The reference is :<br>
    [5<a name="5"></a>] <cite>M.C. Payne, M.P. Teter, D.C. Allan, T.A. Arias and

    techniques for ab initio total-energy calculations: molecular dynamics and 
    conjugate gradients"</cite> <br>
    Note however : the algorithm in that paper was originally designed to perform 
    the potential self-consistency concurrently, but this is not done in ABINIT. 
  <li><b>B.4.</b> The potential-based conjugate-gradient algorithm, used when 
    <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#iscf" target="kwimg">iscf</a>=5 is not published. However, 
    a few elements have already been explained in : <br>

    a potential-based conjugate gradient algorithm for order-N self-consistent 
    total energy calculations"</cite> 
  <li><b>B.5.</b> Many ingredients needed for the calculations of responses to 
    atomic displacements or homogeneous electric fields (dynamical matrices, effective 
    charges and dielectric constants), as well as the Fourier interpolation implemented 
    in the 'anaddb' code are described in <br>

<h3><b><a name="c"></a>C. Examples</b></h3>

The following examples might be enlarged : many explanatory sentences might be added, especially
if they are placed in the technical section of a paper.
On the other hand, perhaps not all the features that are mentioned below have been used, 
in which case some sentences might be removed.

<ul>

  <li><b>C.1. Ground-state calculations.</b> <br>
    The present results have been obtained thanks the use of the ABINIT code 
    [<a href="acknowledgments.html#1">1</a>,
     <a href="acknowledgments.html#2">2</a>, 
     <a href="acknowledgments.html#3">3</a>,
     <a href="acknowledgments.html#15">15</a>]. 
    It relies on an efficient 
    Fast Fourier Transform algorithm [<a href="acknowledgments.html#4">4</a>] 
    for the conversion of wavefunctions between real and reciprocal space, on 
    the adaptation to a fixed potential of the band-by-band conjugate gradient 
    method [<a href="acknowledgments.html#5">5</a>] and on a potential-based 
    conjugate-gradient algorithm for the determination of the self-consistent 
    potential [<a href="acknowledgments.html#6">6</a>].
    Massive parallelism in ABINIT is described in Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#14">14</a>].

  <li><b>C.2. Response-function calculations.</b> <br>
    The following sentence can be considered, in addition of those
    of example C.1 :

<br>
    Technical details on the computation of responses to atomic displacements 
    and homogeneous electric fields can be found in Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#7">7</a>], 
    while Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#8">8</a>] presents the subsequent 
    computation of dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, dielectric permittivity 
    tensors, and interatomic force constants.  Details on the computation 
    of responses to the strain perturbation can be found in Ref.[<a 
    href="acknowledgments.html#9">9</a>], which describes the computation 
    of the elastic, piezoelectric, and internal force-response tensors.
    Details on the computation
    of non-linear responses can be found in Ref.[<a
    href="acknowledgments.html#11">11</a>], which describes the computation
    of the nonlinear optical susceptibilities, Raman efficiencies, and electrooptic 
    tensors from density functional perturbation theory.
    Details on the computation of thermodynamical properties 
    (entropy, free energy, specific heat, atomic temperature factors) obtained by integration
    over the phonon degrees of freedom can be found in Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#12">12</a>].
