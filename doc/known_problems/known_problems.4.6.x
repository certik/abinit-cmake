Known problems

This file contains the list of known problems
at the time a version of ABINIT is released.
Note that bugs discovered later than the
release are NOT described here...
(In particular, at the time of release, a particular
 version is not tested already on ALL platforms,
 only on a subset of 5, usually).

of this file

===============================================

The type of the problem is identified as follows :

NUMERICAL ERROR : the physical result is incorrect,
 but the job does not crash. Moreover,
 the use of the input variables is legitimate.
 This is a very dangerous type of problem. 
 There are two subclasses :
 - INTERNALLY INCOHERENT
  (the bug can be seen because two sets of
   input variables should give the same results
   and do not) 
 - INTRINSIC
  (the bug does not cause incoherency, it can
   only be seen when comparing results with 
   those of another code or with experimental results)
 The latter one is the most dangerous, of course ...

CRASH : the code does not produce the result, because
 it stops unduly.

SLOWING DOWN : the physical result is correct,
 but the code does not go as fast as it should.
 For example, the reading of a restart file might 
 not be correct, or the SCF convergence 
 might not be as fast as it should.

OTHER : some information (not numerical results)
might be erroneous ...

In each class of problem, one can identify
MACHINE-DEPENDENT problems (on some platform, this
problem does not occur, not on others) as well as 
GENERAL problems.

Some of the problems listed below
have been reported by user, but have not yet been
examined for confirmation, in which case they are 
labelled "TO BE CONFIRMED". 

=================================================

for the spin-orbit case and non-collinear magnetism
case.

restartxf for optcell/=0 might have a bug,
despite Test_v1#80

restarting from a different, non-zero, optcell.

in the process of merging the GW code with ABINIT.
To be examined in detail.

P204. (XG, 011020)

MACHINE_DEPENDENT
Test_v3#14 : the output file is machine-dependent,
because the spin-phase of spin-degenerate wavefunctions
has not been fixed...
Or, is there something more fundamental ??

P205. (XG, 011020)
SLOWING DOWN
MACHINE_DEPENDENT ??
On a Intel/Linux PIII 900 MHz, with PGI
compiler, slowing down in getghc,
due to the use of datastructures...

TIMING PROBLEM
MACHINE-DEPENDENT (P6, with IFC compiler v5.0)

P45.18 (D Hamann 050510)
NUMERICAL ERROR
With finite-difference ddk calculation
See his mail of 10 May, 2005.
(Excerpt : ... 

The problem is that 4.4.4 and 4.5.2 WILL run drf.in and produce incorrect
results, all related to the dataset 3 finite-differend ddk calculation.
The results are only somewhat incorrect, not obvious garbage. Here is a
small sample, Born charges from "2nd-order matrix" in the .out files:

Correct (from erf.out):
   1    1   1    4   -4.1367712586    0.0000000000
   1    1   2    4   -0.0863319602    0.0000000000
   1    1   3    4    0.0706059161    0.0000000000

Incorrect (from drf.out):
   1    1   1    4   -3.4782061716    0.0000000000
   1    1   2    4   -0.0832639192    0.0000000000
   1    1   3    4    0.0560776887    0.0000000000


Putting in some istwfk printing, I found that setting berryopt/=0 now forces
istwfk=1 for dataset 3.  The problem apparently is that dataset 2 has some
istwfk>1, and apparently dataset 3 is getting incorrect WFK's from dataset 2
and using them.  Why it doesn't re-converge them first isn't clear.

Setting istwfk=1 in dataset 2 (erf.in) fixes the problem and gets correct
results.  (My hack also had the effect of setting istwfk=1 in dataset 2 as
well as 3.)

Curiously, removing the dataset 2 calculation altogether and feeding the
kptopt1=1 WFK's from dataset 1 directly to the finite-difference ddk
calculation (nrf.in) also fixes the problem, despite the fact that dataset 1
has some istwfk>1.

Clearly something bad is going on in WFK readin, but only in certain cases.
I've never looked at this part of the code, and I'm afraid I can't divert
any more time now towards tracking this down.
