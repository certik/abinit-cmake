 Pspcod=4 corresponds to the case of Teter pseudopotentials
 generated in Louvain-La-Neuve using the code ATOM. Pspcod=5 corresponds
 to "Phoney" pseudopotentials built on a Hamman grid. At this stage (22 July
 1998) it is possible to treat these pseudopotentials (in the version 1.5 and
 later).  However, one has to be careful about the formats of these 
 pseudopotentials. Indeed, to be read by the ABINIT code, they have to be 
 slightly modified. Let's take examples to explain these modifications :

 A. pspcod = 4 case (Teter pseudopotentials). The example corresponds to Lead.

 This header corresponds exactly to these of the TM pseudoptentials (pspcod=1).
 In addition, in the new form of the Teter pseudopotentials, one indicates the
 number of angular momentum before each set of data corresponding to the 
 considered angular momentum. This allows a clearer pseudopotential file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 B. pspcod = 5 case ("Phoney" pseudopotentials). 
    The example corresponds to Oxygen.

 Note that this header is almost the same as for the pspcod=1 and pspcod=4 case. 
 The only difference lies in the presence of "r1" and "al" parameters (defining 
 the Hamman grid). Here also, we indicate in addition the number of each angular
 momentum before the set of data corresponding to the considered angular 
 momentum. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Inside ABINIT, a pseudopotential with format 4 will be treated by
     the routine psp1in.f, that calls psp1lo.f (local part),
     psp1nl.f (non-local part), and psp1cc (core correction).

     As a matter of numerical accuracy, note that the integral
     of (V(r)+Zion/r) r^2 in psp1lo.f is performed from 0 to the highest 
     allowed radius (usually about 100 a.u.), without cut-off.
     V(r)+Zion/r should tend rapidly to zero
     for large radii (beyond 5 a.u.), but this correct behaviour will
     not be enforced by psp1lo . If the tail of V(r) is inaccurate
     (i.e. if the pseudopotential is in single precision), there
     will be large inaccuracies in the integral, because of the r^2
     factor.

     By contrast, a pseudopotential with format 5 will be treated by
     the routine psp5in.f, that calls psp5lo.f (local part), 
     psp5nl.f (non-local part), and psp5cc (core correction).

     The integral of (V(r)+Zion/r) r^2 in psp5lo.f is performed 
     from 0 to the highest allowed radius (usually about 100 a.u.), 
     except that beyond 20 a.u. no value of abs(V(r)) larger
     than 2.0d-8 is tolerated. This will allow to cut off spurious
     behaviour of pseudopotential whose data file is written in 
     single precision.
