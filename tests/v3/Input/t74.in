# Oxygen molecule, treated with fixed occupation numbers, 
# with LDA.
# This is to demonstrate a subtlety of the analysis of
# finite differences : the effect of the symmetrization.
# In dataset 1-3, one computes the total energy and forces,
# with automatic computation of symmetries, including
# symmetrization of the forces
# In dataset 4, RF is computed, and the agreement with 
# finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is quite bad: 1.5% error
# However, the agreement with the finite differences
# of forces in datasets 5 and 6, where the symmetrization
# of forces is not done is perfect. And this is the correct
# behaviour.
# Explanation : forces in the geometry of datasets 1,3,5 and 6 
# are not really symmetric, because of the underlying XC grid !!
