# Oxygen molecule, treated with varying occupation numbers, 
# with LDA.
#    This is to demonstrate a subtlety of the analysis of
#    finite differences : for metallic occupation numbers,
#    RF computation of 2DTE at Gamma, when taking
#    Fermi energy changes (frzfermi=0), will give the same
#    answer than finite-difference of GS computations.
#    However, in order to find a coherent phonon
#    band structure, and perform the Fourier interpolation,
#    it is likely that the Fermi energy must be frozen
#    (debate was running between Dhamann and XG as of 20040821)
