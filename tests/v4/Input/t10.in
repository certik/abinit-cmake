#Computes the ACFD-RPA correlation energy of an He atom in a big box,
#using:
# a) Gauss-Legendre integration along the imaginary frequency axis,
#    on a predefined grid.
# b) Gauss-Legendre integration for the coupling constant, with
#    3 points (excluding 0 and 1). The Dyson equation is solved
#    as a linear system.
#Also computes the RPA polarizabilities of the He atom at various frequencies.
