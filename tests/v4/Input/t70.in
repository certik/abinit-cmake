!the flags
dieflag 4  !the frequency dependent dielectric tensor is calculated
elaflag  4  !the flag for the elastic constant
piezoflag 7  
instrflag 1  !the flag for the internal strain tensor

!the effective charge part

! Wavevector list number 1

nph1l 1 !number of phonons in list 1
qph1l  0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 !the Gamma point

! Wave vector list no. 2

nph2l 1  !number of phonons in list 2
qph2l 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0  ! why here the normalization factor is 0
