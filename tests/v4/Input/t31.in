#Driver

surf  1 # build the Bader surface
crit  2 # determine the critical points
atom  1 # The basin of attraction of atom 1 will be examined
gpsurf 1 # output for GNUplot
irho  1  # drives the integration of the Bader charge

#Parameter

# nsa 2  #  one might gain a bit of cpu time
# nsb 2  #  by using these values, smaller than the default 
# nsc 2 

inpt 50     # This value is suitable 
ntheta 5   # This value is much too small
nphi 5     # This value is much too small
thetamax   1.57079632679   # These two variables define an octant
phimax   1.57079632679     #
maxatd   14.0   # Important to include enough starting atoms,
                # in this system with quite large separations between atoms
