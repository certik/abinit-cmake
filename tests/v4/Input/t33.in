#Driver

atom  1  # The basin of attraction of Oxygen atom will be examined
crit  2  # determine the critical points
surf  1  # build the Bader surface
gpsurf 1  # output for GNUplot
irho  1   # drives the integration of the Bader charge

#Parameter

# nsa 2  #  one might gain a bit of cpu time
# nsb 2  #  by using these values, smaller than the default 
# nsc 2 

inpt 50      # This value is suitable
ntheta 8    # This value is much too small
nphi 4       # This value is much too small
thetamax   3.14159265358  # These two variables define a quadrant
phimax   1.57079632679    #
  maxatd 10.9   # The starting atoms within this distance are sufficient
  maxcpd 8.0 
  lgrad2 1.0d-4  # Such loose criteria are needed to catch all the CPs.
  lstep2 1.0d-4  #
  dpclim 5.0d-2  # Because the ecut is quite low, the finite elements
                 # are quite large. So, it might be that ONE critical point
                 # is seen on TWO finite elements, while being at a larger
                 # distance that the default value of dpclim
