!Input file for the ifc code. Analysis of a restricted SiO2 DDB 
!Will use only the Gamma point information : compute 
!Compute LO-TO splitting for different directions,
!as well as the dielectric tensor at zero frequency

!Flags
 dieflag   1     ! Frequency-dependent Dielectric tensor flag

!Effective charges
 asr     1       ! Acoustic Sum Rule. 1 => imposed asymetrically
 chneut  2       ! Charge neutrality requirement for effective charges. 
                 !        2=> imposed with weights proportional to screening)
