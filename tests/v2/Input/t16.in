!Flags
 ifcflag   1     ! Interatomic force constant flag
 thmflag   1     ! Thermal flag. Gives Internal energy, entropy,
                 !   heat capacity, phonon DOS, Debye-Waller factor)

!Effective charges
     asr   1     ! Acoustic Sum Rule. 1 => imposed asymetrically
  chneut   1     ! Charge neutrality requirement for effective charges.
                 !        1=> equal portion of the missing charge

!Interatomic force constant info
