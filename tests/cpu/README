Start these tests by using run-standard-tests in the ABINIT tests directory.
Different series of runs will be executed.
These are :

A1 , for tests with small real space grids (and corresponding ecut),
  in a 10x10x10 cubic cell containing two atoms aligned to form a chain.
  The real space grids have linear size 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 32, 36 and 40.
  Two k-points (0 0 0) and (0 0 1/2) are used.
  The variable fftalg is set to 101 and istwfk is set to 1 1.
  On a Pentium Pro 200 MHz, the whole test takes about 3 minutes.

A2, same as A1, but with fftalg 200 , istwfk 1 1

A3, same as A1, but with fftalg 112 , istwfk 1 1
       The output of this run serves as reference for the A series,
       except A6.

A4, same as A1, but with fftalg 400 , istwfk 1 1

A5, same as A1, but with fftalg 401 , istwfk 1 1

A6, same as A1, but with fftalg 112, and istwfk being the default.
       WARNING : the numerical results differs from those of the
       other Ax tests.


B1 , for tests with large real space grids (and corresponding ecut),
  in a 10x10x10 cubic cell containing two atoms aligned to form a chain.
  The real space grids have linear size 48, 60, 64, 72, 80, 90, 96.
  One k-point (0 0 0) is used.
  The variable fftalg is set to 101 and istwfk is set to 1 1.
  On a Pentium Pro, the whole test takes about 12 minutes.

B2, same as B1, but with fftalg 200 , istwfk 1 

B3, same as B1, but with fftalg 112 , istwfk 1
       The output of this run serves as reference for the B series,
       except B6.

B4, same as B1, but with fftalg 400 , istwfk 1

B5, same as B1, but with fftalg 401 , istwfk 1

B6, same as B1, but with fftalg 112, and istwfk being the default.
       WARNING : the numerical results differs from those of the
       other Bx tests.

C3 , for tests with larger and larger unit cells :
  10x10x10 , 10x10x20 , 10x20x20 and 20x20x20 , containing 2, 4, 8 and 16 atoms.
  The variable fftalg is set to 112. One k point is used.
  On a Pentium Pro 200 MHz, the whole test takes about 1 minutes.
  This test should be worked again, since the boxes with 2 and 4 atoms
  are too fast, and to not allow to deliver accurate time measurements.
  

D3, same as B3, except k points, and with real space grids having
  linear size 25, 27, 45, 50, 54, 75, 81.

For each of these cases, a directory where all the results of the tests 
are stored is created.
It contains also a report on the suite of test, and the difference
of this report with a reference report.
