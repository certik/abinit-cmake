# forces, stresses ... in a whole set of files
# Output will be written in the file "report"

# Usage :
# unix C-shell: make-cpu-report file ... >& log_file 
# unix bash:	make-cpu-report file ... >log_file 2>&1
# Windows DOS box: [perl] make-cpu-report.pl file ... >log_file
#
# Of course, you can use metacharacters (e.g. make-cpu-report *), in order
# to scan a very large set of files in a directory

# To set up the information wanted in the report, mention all key words in the
# keyword array ( @keyword = ... )
# Then for each key word, define the range of lines to be printed in the
# linemin and linemax arrays. These are the numbers of the first and last line
# relatively to the line where the key word stands, being counted as 1.
# Note that only the first occurrence of a keyword will give an output in the
# report, not the subsequent ones.
# For example, if you want the atomic positions, when two atoms are present,
# from an 'output' file, you need to get two lines, the first being identified
# by the keyword ' xred ', you would write:
#	@keyword = (' xred ');
#	@linemin = (  1   );
#	@linemax = (  2   );
#
# Here is a more elaborate example with multiple keywords :
#	@keyword=('getcut',' xred ','dE','Ewald');
#	@linemin=(   1    ,   1    , 1  ,  1   );
#	@linemax=(   2    ,   2    , 3  ,  1   );
$, = ' ';               # set output field separator
$\ = "\n";              # set output record separator

# Here set up the information; 
@keyword = ('getcut','Arith','Band','Detailed','Overall' );
@linemin = (   1    ,   1   ,   1  ,    1     ,  1 );
@linemax = (   2    ,   1   ,   1  ,   12     ,  1 );
