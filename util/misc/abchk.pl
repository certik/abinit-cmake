# this program reads through an abinit input file, and checks to see
# whether each variable encountered can be matched to a variable in the
# abinit input list. The purpose is to avoid input errors of the type
# "rfstr" instead of the correct "rfstrs"; since abinit has defaults for
# many variables, if it reads an unknown name it seems to just ignore the
# input and continue on with the default.

# usage: abchk <input file name>
# output: variables in the input file that didn't match the glossary
# program returns the number of unmatched variables, which makes it
# also useful in shell scripts

# here are many of the abinit variables. You can add more.
