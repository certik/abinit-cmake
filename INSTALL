===========================================================================

The instructions are contained in the
doc/install_notes directory .

You can find instructions in
http://www.abinit.org/developers/?text=ab5_10steps

In short, if you have bazaar installed, and got one version from
the archive, the steps are :
(1) ./config/scripts/makemake    (or */*/makemake)
(2) ./configure  (or first create a tmp directory, then cd tmp, then ../configure)
(3) ./make       (or ./make multi  for using 4 proc of an SMP machine)
Then you might also need 
(4) ./make install   

===========================================================================

This program requires a Standard Fortran 90 compiler; if you have
an older Fortran 77-only compiler, please install a Fortran 90 one
first.

To build the executables you will need at least 400 Mb of free disk space.
Running all tests will require more than 2.5 Gb.

GNU AUTOTOOLS SUPPORT

This version of ABINIT includes full support for the GNU Autotools. If you
make changes to the source code and/or the documentation, you may need
recent test versions of GNU build tools to regenerate the intermediate
files (e.g. Makefile.am, Makefile.in, config.h.in).

The following versions were used to generate the intermediate files in
this distribution:

 * GNU Autoconf 2.59 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.59.tar.gz>

 * GNU Automake 1.9 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.9.6.tar.gz>

 * GNU Libtool 1.5 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-1.5.22.tar.gz>

 * GNU M4 1.4 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.4.tar.gz>

 * DocBook-utils 0.6.13 <http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/>

A software bundle is available from the ABINIT website. See
http://www.abinit.org/gnu/ for details.

Any question regarding the GNU Autotools support inside ABINIT should be
directed to Yann Pouillon <pouillon@pcpm.ucl.ac.be>.
