Adding a new directory 
======================

Instructions can be adapted to move a directory inside src ( see point 4)
Do this only if you have the autotools...

0) create your directory, fill it, and add the infos in the bzr system

1) in config.ac, declare the directory in AC_CONFIG_FILES(...)

2) in config/specs/libraries.cf , declare the new directory,
and its dependencies upon the external libraries

3) in config/specs/binaries.cf , specify the main codes that 
depends on the routines contained in this new directory

4) in config/makefiles/top.am , specify the corresponding compilation
in one of the "multi" tasks




Then, in order for the make to work :
 issue */*/makemake, then configure and make

In case of a move, check that the doc (or other files) does not need any update.
Advice : find the occurrences thanks to 
grep name_of_directory * 
grep name_of_directory */*
