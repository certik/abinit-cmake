 ****p* NIGHTLY/timeout
 * NAME
 *  timeout
 *
 * FUNCTION
 *  Executes a command and imposes an elapsed time limit. The command
 *  is run in a separate POSIX process group so that the right thing
 *  happens with commands that spawn child processes.
 *

 *
 * NOTES
 *  Command line: timeout [-<signal>] time command
 *
 *    -<signal>
 *      Specify an optional signal to send to the controlled process.
 *      By default, timeout sends SIGKILL, which cannot be caught or
 *      ignored.
 *
 *    time
 *      The elapsed time limit after which the command is terminated.
 *
 *    command
 *      The command to be executed.
 *
 *    The exit status is the one of the command (status 1 in case of a
 *    usage error).
