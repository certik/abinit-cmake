These routines are wrapper around the Poisson solver of BigDFT. It is used to compute the convolution with 1/r and to compute the exchange and coreelation related stuffs (potential, energies...).

To do it, one must use a kernel. Create it with psolver_kernel() (iaction == 2 to get it and build it if not already created). Then it can be used in psolver_rhohxc()) that is the equivalent with free boundary conditions to rhohxc(). It can also be used in psolver_hartree() which only does the convolution and does not compute XC.
