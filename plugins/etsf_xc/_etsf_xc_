!! NAME
!!  Lib_etsf_xc
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!  This subdirectory contains the version 0.9 of the Octopus XC library.
!!  It is available at:
!!
!!    http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc:download
!!
!!  In ABINITv5.0, it is optionally compiled into abinis, and
!!  should be used with care.
!!  The --enable-etsf-xc option of the configure script has to be
!!  used at compile time.
!!
!!  In order to have the Octopus XC library working, this subdirectory
!!  contains a SVN checkout of the LibString_F library as well
!!  (svn co http://www.tddft.org/svn/octopus/trunk/libstring_f) from
!!  2006. This very simple library tries to do what many think impossible:
!!  to allow the passage of strings between Fortran and C and vice-versa.
!!
!!  These routines do not follow the ABINIT coding rules
!!  (~abinit/doc/developers/rules_coding).
